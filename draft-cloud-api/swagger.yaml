        or if the request is authorized with a valid API key.

        Updates the content of a `Document` with content provided in the request body.
        Document content is text or arbitrary JSON data provided in the request body
        (see the request Content-Type header parameter).

        If a [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to a subpart of the document is given at the end of the URL (see GET),
        then the content provided in this PUT request replaces the content at the location in the
        document that the pointer points to and the operation in the revision in the response body is
        relative to that part of the document.

        If a base revision is specified with the Base-Revision-Id header, then the changes made
        relative to the base revision will be merged with the changes made in any Revisions that
        were made after the base revision (probably by other users acting simultaneously).

        The response is a new uncommitted `Revsion` object, meaning it has not yet been applied
        to the document. Revisions are applied in an asynchronous manner, so the document's content
        and history will reflect the new Revision after a few moments.

          description: An optional `Revision` UUID that the new document content is based on. May be `singularity` indicating that the base revision is the implicit revision that exists when a document is first created. If not specified, the base revision is the document's current revision.
        - name: Content-Type
          in: header
          type: string
          description: Either `text/plain` if you are sending a plain text document (it is converted to a JSON string) or `application/json` if you are sending arbitrary JSON data as the document.

    patch:
      description: |
        Updates the content of a `Document` with a raw JOT operation provided in the request body.
        
        If a [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to a subpart of the document is given at the end of the URL (see GET),
        then the operation applies to that location in the document that the pointer points to and the operation in the revision in the response body is
        relative to that part of the document.
        
        If a base revision is specified with the Base-Revision-Id header, then the operation
        will be transformed to apply logically as if the changes made in any Revisions that
        were made after the base revision were made simultaneously.
        
        The response is a new uncommitted `Revsion` object, meaning it has not yet been applied
